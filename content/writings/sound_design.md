title: Sound Synthesis for the Free World

The unfortunate reality for people who work with sound and in sound adjacent disciplines is that most of the full-featured [software](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum-2) and [hardware](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Sub37--moog-subsequent-37-analog-synthesizer?gQT=1) in this area is both absurdly costly for the budding individual creative and closed source for developers and hobby tinkerers.

![Absurd prices for plugins](/personal_website/img/tf.jpg "Bonkers pricing for industry standard plugins. A trivial matter for industry giants but a big deal for those just starting out.")
This really sucks for several reasons:
1. It deters talented up and coming creators from producing amazing works of art and
2. It deters talented developers with a passion for sound synthesis from helping to produce amazing software and hardware, and
3. It deters a more collaborative environment that boosts productivity on both ends of the sound synthesis stick

The ethos behind the work done at [BRLD](https://www.brldsound.com) is to produce high-quality tools, patches, and sounds for all musicians that are truly free. 
- Monetarily, [BRLD](https://www.brldsound.com) operates on a pay what you want model for both patches, software, and hardware design. You can send as much or as little as you want. All funds are used to help sustain the [BRLD](https://www.brldsound.com) project.
- Developmentally, [BRLD](https://www.brldsound.com) is dedicated to providing all the source code and designs associated with the products we release under a permissive BSD license. We believe that derivative works (even those that are closed) are a step forward for the community.
- In terms of accessibility, we put a special focus on making our products as user-oriented as possible.

This helps our community 2-fold, bolstering both individual creativity and learning for the developer.

We envision a world where this mindset is dominant. Check out our work done at [BRLD](https://www.brldsound.com) if this is a world you'd like to be a part of.
