# Andrew's Music Zine

![Andrew's Music Zine]()
A collection of writings on all my favorite music of all time, in no particular order. Divided by genre for easier organization. Hopefully you'll find a tune or two from this list that you will love as much I do.

Music has without a doubt been the greatest source of creative inspiration to me. I count myself lucky to have been born to a generation that had easy access to the internet's music.

## Electronic
### 1. [Lorde - Tennis Court (Flume Remix)]() {{< icon "spotify" >}}
{{< spotify type="track" id="4fnBNNoBiRqDgTTk3ZQo3E" width="100%" height="100" >}}
Flume's magnus opus. Luscious synths, otherwordly orchestral backing, creative sound design and use, in addition to Johnathan Zawada's incredible visuals, combine to form visual and auditory liquid gold. Absolute masterpiece of a song and pays homage to the greatness of Lorde.

### 2. [Oh Wonder - Body Gold (Louis the Child Remix)]()

A hallmark future bass remix of an already beautiful song. Minimal yet full of intricate sound design.

### 3. [Galantis - Runaway U & I]() {{< icon "spotify" >}} 
The most formative song from my childhood, informed my taste to this day. Pharmacy is top 3 albums from my childhood, and Runwaway U & I is the most nostalgic song off the album. A swim practice locker room classic jam.

### 4. [Sam Gellaitry - HYENA]()  {{< icon "spotify" >}}
The Scottish phenom's greatest work. He professed himself that it was the first song that he was truly proud of. Incredible sound design, creativity, and bounce. The crowd understandably went crazy when Sammy G dropped this heater during his Boiler Room set.

### 5. [Ivy Lab - Teacup]() {{< icon "spotify" >}}
The duo that forms Ivy Lab are two of the most forward thinking beat makers of our generation. Dark, feral, aggressive, Ivy Lab's sound is formidable. Incredibly intricate soundscape.


### 6. [Lemaitre - Splitting Colors]()
Another one of the most formative songs from my childhood. Another sound design phenom duo. Reminiscient of Justice's D.A.N.C.E with flares of Daft Punk smoothness.

### 7. [SOPHIE - Faceshopping]()
SOPHIE is one of the greatest sound designers of our generation without a doubt. Industrial sounds broken by a luscious synth interlude. A social commentary on keeping up appearances.
