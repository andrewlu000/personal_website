I was recently in a conversation with one of my friends

Spotify has thus far done the best job of centralization, aggregating a catalogue of high quality music -> features that can be tapped into an ecosystem as much as possible

- music streaming needs a standard
- just like why out IEEE standards are important


- mastodon but for music streaming?
	- federated music streaming
		- things like FunkWhale
		- also not enough incentive for artists -> where is streaming revenue going to come from?
			- 

	- you use whatever servers -> artists choose the servers that they want to post on/are treating them the best -> users can just add the server and listen!
	- singular client/internal algorithm

- what we need in the world is for everyone to use decentralized services
	- a singular service that is used by everyone, but everyone has a input in what gets created/the customization that is important
- take music sttreaming for example
	- music on multiple streaming platforms is an absolute pain in the ass
		- painful for the consumer: need to have multple subscriptions in order to listen to all favorite artists
		- painful for the artist: needing to upload/manage on multiple platforms
		  
- thesis:
	- have a subscription model -> payments go to running the service + paying out open source developers who do important tasks for the app

- centralization of use, not of power in an organization

# What is Deterring This From Happening?
- current services
	- subscriptions would most likely not be enough to support full time developers working on the app
- blockchain music?

- ubiquity is a good thing for software
- meta ecosystem of open source software


- rethinking how creators are paid
	- as opposed to ad revenue
	- there is a consumer expectation that content is "free"
