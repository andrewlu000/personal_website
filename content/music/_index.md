# Top 100
A collection of all my favorite music of all time, in no particular order. Divided by genre for easier organization.


## Electronic
### 1. [Lorde - Tennis Court (Flume Remix)]() {{< icon "spotify" >}} (10/10)

Flume's magnus opus. Luscious synths, otherwordly orchestral backing, creative sound design and use, in addition to Johnathan Zawada's incredible visuals, combine to form visual and auditory liquid gold. Absolute masterpiece of a song and pays homage to the greatness of Lorde.

### 2. [Oh Wonder - Body Gold (Louis the Child Remix)]() (10/10)

A hallmark future bass remix of an already beautiful song. Minimal yet full of intricate sound design.

### 3. [Galantis - Runaway U & I]() {{< icon "spotify" >}} (10/10)
One of the most formative songs from my childhood, informed my taste to this day. Pharmacy is top 3 albums from my childhood.

### 4. [Sam Gellaitry - HYENA]()  {{< icon "spotify" >}}
The Scottish phenom's greatest work. He professed himself that it was the first song that he was truly proud of. Incredible sound design, creativity, and bounce. The crowd understandably went crazy when Sammy G dropped this heater during his Boiler Room set.

### 5. [Ivy Lab - Teacup]() {{< icon "spotify" >}}
The duo that form Ivy Lab are some of the most forward thinking beat makers of our generation. Dark, feral, aggressive, Ivy Lab's sound is formidable. Incredibly intricate masterpiece.


### 6. [Lemaitre - Splitting Colors]()
Another one of the most formative songs from my childhood. Another sound design phenom duo. Reminiscient of Justice's D.A.N.C.E

### 7. [SOPHIE - Faceshopping]()
SOPHIE is the greatest sound designer of our generation without a doubt.
