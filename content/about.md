I am an undergraduate computer engineer @ the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My research interests include embedded systems, computer vision, and digital design/verification.

In my free time, I work on [sound design](https://www.patreon.com/c/crappysoundsmith) and [synthesizer design](https://www.patreon.com/c/crappysoundsmith). I am also an avid fan of [competitive CS2](https://www.faceit.com/en/players/alu0), swimming, and table tennis.

Feel free to [contact me]().
