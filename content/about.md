I am an undergraduate computer engineer @ the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My research interests span embedded systems, computer architecture, chip design, computer vision, digital design/verification, and crypto. I am passionate about building open utilities in these fields to help facilitate more free and open society.

In my free time, I work on [sound design](https://www.patreon.com/c/crappysoundsmith) and [synthesizer design](https://www.patreon.com/c/crappysoundsmith) for the [BRLD]() banner, in addition to [writing music](). I am also an avid fan of [competitive CS2](https://www.faceit.com/en/players/alu0), swimming, and table tennis.

Feel free to [contact me]().
